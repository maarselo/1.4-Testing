# 1.4-Testing
# ⚠️ 1.3-JUnit-Testing

A complete set of exercises focused on unit testing in Java using JUnit and AssertJ.  
This project demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and various testing techniques to ensure code quality and reliability.

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This repository contains the full solution for **Sprint 1 - JUnit Testing** of the Java programming track.  
The sprint is divided into three levels, each focusing on different testing techniques:

### �🧪 Level 1: JUnit Basics

**Exercise 1**  
Implements a `Library` class to manage book collections with tests verifying all required functionalities.

**Exercise 2**  
Creates a `CalculoDni` class that calculates DNI letters with parameterized tests for validation.

**Exercise 3**  
Demonstrates testing for `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### 🔍 Level 2: AssertJ Assertions

Exercises 1-7 cover various AssertJ assertions including:
- Primitive value comparisons
- Object reference comparisons
- Array validations
- Collection assertions
- Map validations
- Exception testing
- Optional object testing

### 🚀 Level 3: Test-Driven Development

Implements a `Calculadora` class using TDD methodology:
- Tests written before implementation
- Iterative development process
- Continuous refactoring

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Java (SDK 17+)
